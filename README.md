#A very basic Weather App

In this project I'll be building a very simplistic weather application. 
Using the OpenWeatherAPI a user can submit a form with one input field, to be able to search for the weather in any city around the world.
The API presents both local weather data for that area and a small icon depciting the weather as well.
The user will be able to look up to 60 cities a minute.
Another feature will allow the user to be able to like or dislike the weather displayed.
